# Hand-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition is a type of pattern recognition system that can automatically identify the digits (0–9) written by hand. It is one of the most common applications of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), especially using Neural Networks.
# 🖐️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on building a **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** that can accurately identify digits (0–9) from handwritten images using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
It is based on the popular **MNIST dataset** and demonstrates how neural networks can learn to classify image patterns.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Dataset Loading**  
   The MNIST dataset containing 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images is loaded.
2. **Preprocessing**  
   Images are normalized and reshaped for model compatibility.
3. **Model Training**  
   A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or fully connected Neural Network is trained.
4. **Prediction**  
   The trained model predicts digits from new handwritten images.
5. **Evaluation**  
   Model accuracy and loss are plotted and analyzed.
6. **Streamlit App (Optional)**  
   The project can be deployed as a web app where users draw digits for prediction.
